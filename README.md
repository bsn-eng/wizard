# Wizard SDK
The Wizard SDK allows users to interact with the LSD network and Giant pools. Using the SDK anyone can deploy their own LSD, interact with the new or the existing LSDs. The SDK is written in typescript and uses typechain to generate types from the ABIs.  

> It is recommended to use `ethers.js` as the SDK uses it throughout.  

## Pre-installations
The LSD Wizard typescript SDK needs following pre-installations to compile:
```bash
yarn add typescript typechain @typechain/ethers-v5 @types/lodash
```

## Installation
To install the SDK use the command `yarn add @blockswaplab/lsd-wizard`  

## Using the SDK
One of the ways to import and initialize the Wizard SDK is:
```js
const { Wizard } = require('@blockswaplab/lsd-wizard');
// or import
// import { Wizard } from '@blockswaplab/lsd-wizard';

const provider = new ethers.providers.InfuraProvider("goerli", {
    projectId: INFURA_PROJECT_ID,
    projectSecret: INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET
});
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(PRIV_KEY, provider);

// The addresses used below are for representation. Anyone is free to initialise the SDK with their own LSD's respective addresses.  
const wizard = new Wizard({
    signerOrProvider: signer, // signer or provider
    liquidStakingManagerAddress: "0x1779642181f0f799582e9ebe9615f96c744e527b", // optional
    savETHPoolAddress: "0x4857819f7a29c73f4a005dd907e01333383d2f81", // optional
    feesAndMevPoolAddress: "0x7635c5d48b0c0b99a66628b3c1297ed5bb395bb9" // optional
});
```
`signerOrProvider` parameter: ethers.js `signer` or `provider` instance. With `provider` instance only the `view` functions from the smart contract are executable.  
`liquidStakingManagerAddress` parameter: Address of the specific LSD to execute functions from. This is an optional parameter. When `null`, none of the functions from LSD's Liquid Staking Manager can be executed via the SDK.  
`savETHPoolAddress` parameter: Address of the Protected Staking pool of any LSD. This is an optional parameter. When `null`, none of none of the functions from the LSD's Protected Staking pool can be executed via the SDK. This address can be from any LSD, which means a user can query a function from Liquid Staking Manager of LSD-1 and also execute a function from Protected Staking pool of LSD-2.  
`feesAndMevPoolAddress` parameter: Address of the Fess and MEV pool of any LSD. This is an optional parameter. When `null`, none of the functions from the LSD's Fees and MEV pool can be executed via the SDK. This address can be from any LSD, which means a user can query a function from Liquid Staking Manager of LSD-1 and also execute a function from Fees and MEV pool of LSD-2.  

To deploy a new LSD network, the SDK only needs the `signerOrProvider` parameter.  

## Sub classes
The SDK exposes various sub-classes:  
* [deployer](#deployer-sub-class)  
* [utils](#utils-sub-class)  
* [savETHPool](#saveth-pool-sub-class)  
* [feesAndMevPool](#fees-and-mev-sub-class)  
* [giantSavETHPool](#giant-saveth-pool-sub-class)  
* [giantFeesAndMevPool](#giant-fees-and-mev-sub-class)  
* [contractInstance](#contract-instance-sub-class)  
* constants  

## Deployer sub-class:  
This sub package deals with deployment of a new LSD network. Any user that initializes the Wizard SDK with `signerOrProvider` instance can access this sub-class.

## Giant Fees and MEV sub-class
This sub-class exposes all the necessary functions from the Giant Fees and MEV pool of the LSD Network. For anyone to use this sub-class, it is necessary to initialize the sub-class with `signerOrProvider` instance and `feesAndMevPoolAddress`.  

### batchDepositETHForStaking function
This function allows users to deposit ETH in batches from the Giant Fees and MEV pool to multiple Fees and MEV pools of different LSD Networks. A node runner should be on a lookout in case the pool is falling short of ETH and when the Giant pool gets funded with ETH, he can then use these ETH in the respective LSD network to get them staked.  

#### Input params
`feesAndMevPoolAddresses`: List of address of Fees and MEV pool to transfer ETH to  
`amounts`: List of number of ETH to be transferred to each of the Fees and MEV pools  
`blsPublicKeys`: 2 dimensional array of address of BLS public keys which receive ETH  
`stakeAmounts`: 2 dimensional array of amount of ETH to be transferred to each of the BLS public keys  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.batchDepositETHForStaking(feesAndMevPoolAddresses, amounts, blsPublicKeys, stakeAmounts);
```

### claimRewards function
Allows a giant LP to claim a percentage of the revenue received by the MEV and Fees Pool.  

#### Input params
`recipient`: Recipient address that receives the ETH from revenue  
`feesAndMevPoolAddresses`: List of address of Fees and MEV pools to claim revenue from  
`blsPublicKeys`: 2 dimensional list of BLS public keys to claim portion of revenue from  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.claimRewards(recipient, feesAndMevPoolAddresses, blsPublicKeys);
```

### previewAccumulatedETH function
Allows users to preview ETH accumulated by an address.  

#### Input params
`userAddress`: Ethereum execution layer address to find ETH accumulation for  
`feesAndMevPoolAddresses`: List of address of Fees and MEV pools  
`lpTokens`: 2 dimensional array of address of LP tokens  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.previewAccumulatedETH(userAddress, feesAndMevPoolAddresses, lpTokens);
```

#### Returns
Accumulated ETH in Big Numbers.  

### bringUnusedETHBackIntoGiantPool function
Allows user to bring back unstaked ETH from the Fees and MEV pool of different LSD Networks to the Giant Fees and MEV Pool.  

#### Input params
`feesAndMevPoolAddresses`: List of address of Fees and MEV pool to bring back ETH from  
`lpTokens`: 2 dimensional array of address of LP tokens that the Giant pool holds for specific Fees and MEV Pools to bring back ETH  
`amounts`: 2 dimensional array of number of ETH to be brought back  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.bringUnusedETHBackIntoGiantPool(feesAndMevPoolAddresses, lpTokens, amounts);
```

###  function
Updates the accrued ETH per LP token.  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.updateAccumulatedETHPerLP();
```

### depositETH function
Allows users to deposit ETH into the Giant Fees and MEV Pool in exchange of LP tokens. The LP tokens hold 1:1 relationship with ETH until the ETH is staked. Once staked, the users can start earning and claiming rewards for every Giant LP they hold.  

#### Input params
`amount`: Number of ETH to be staked  
`ethValue`: Amount of ETH to be attached with the transaction  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.depositETH(amount, ethValue);
```

### getIdleETH function
Allows user to fetch number of idle ETH in the pool.  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.getIdleETH();
```

#### Returns
Amount of idle ETH in Big Numbers.  

### withdrawETH function
Allows user to withdraw ETH by burning the LP token as long as the ETH has not been staked.  

#### Input params
`amount`: Number of LP tokens to be burnt  

#### Using the function
```js
await wizard.giantFeesAndMevPool.withdrawETH(amount);
```

## Contract Instance sub-class
This sub-class allows users to get the contract instance of specific smart contracts of the LSD network. This turns out to be useful when a function from one of the smart contracts is not exposed in Wizard SDK directly. For a user to use this sub-class, it is necessary to initialize the Wizard SDK with the `signer` instance.  

### Contracts exposed via the sub-class
* lsdnFactory: LSDN factory (used to deploy a new LSD Network)  
* liquidStakingManager  
* savETHVault: Protected Staking Pool smart contract  
* feesAndMevPool  
* giantSavETHPool: Giant Protected Staking Pool smart contract  
* giantFeesAndMevPool  

### Getting the contract instances
* LSDN Factory
```js
const contract = (await wizard.contractInstance).lsdnFactory();
```

* Liquid Staking Manager
```js
const contract = (await wizard.contractInstance).liquidStakingManager(LIQUID_STAKING_MANAGER_ADDRESS);
```

* Protected Staking Pool
```js
const contract = (await wizard.contractInstance).savETHVault(PROTECTED_STAKING_POOL_ADDRESS);
```

* Fees and MEV Pool
```js
const contract = (await wizard.contractInstance).feesAndMevPool(FEES_AND_MEV_POOL_ADDRESS);
```

* Giant Protected Staking Pool
```js
const contract = (await wizard.contractInstance).giantSavETHPool();
```

* Giant Fees and MEV Pool
```js
const contract = (await wizard.contractInstance).giantFeesAndMevPool();
```
